Hi,
Thank You for purchashing my software from the Unity Asset Store.

Super Level Optimizer is very easy to use in Your projects. To include it in Your project, go to the menu and select Tools/NGSTools/SuperLevelOptimizer/Create Optimizer.

These are components that make up the Super Level Optimizer asset:

1) "Save Colliders". With the inclusion of this option, the colliders attached to objects will be kept.
2) "Coefficients table". The table of admissible errors for material parameters. (It is mentioned in the video instructions in more detail).
3) "Bake Type". Scene baking type. "BakeType/Zonal" allows You to work with Occlusion Culling. It is only recommended to apply on big scenes. (More details in the video instructions).
4) "SearchState". With the "Automatic" setting, Super Level Optimizer will combine all "batching static" objects. With the "User" setting, You will be able to choose the objects for optimization.
5) "Combine State". With "Combine To Scene", the objects will remain in the scene. With "Combine To Prefab", the objects will remain in the folder chosen.
6) "Create Atlases". Will generate atlases.
7) "Combine Meshes". Will combine meshes.
8) "Destroy Sources". Will destroy initial objects.


Additional Features:

It is possible to create a prefab of any object. For this purpose, allocate the necessary objects under the "Tools/NGSTools/Super Level Optimizer/Create Prefab" settings. The prefab will remain in the "SLO/Prefabs/" folder.

How to edit the created atlases? For this purpose, create the prefab according to the instructions above, then place this in the "SLO/Textures/" folder.
